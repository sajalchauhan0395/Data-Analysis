Project Title: Comprehensive Analysis of Zomato Restaurant Data Using Python


Project Description:
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Zomato restaurant data to uncover insights and trends within the restaurant industry. Utilizing Python and essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQLite, and Seaborn, this project aims to provide a thorough understanding of various factors affecting restaurants listed on Zomato, such as ratings, location distribution, pricing, and cuisine popularity.

Objectives:
Data Extraction and Storage:

Load the Zomato dataset and inspect its structure.
Store the dataset in an SQLite database for efficient querying.
Extract relevant data using SQL queries.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values and duplicates.
Convert data types as necessary for analysis.
Normalize and preprocess data for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
Visualize the distribution of restaurants across different cities.
Analyze the distribution of ratings and identify patterns.
Investigate the price range of restaurants and its correlation with ratings.
Explore the popularity of various cuisines.
Visualization:

Create insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Use bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and heatmaps to illustrate data trends and patterns.
Develop geographic distribution maps of restaurants if geospatial data is available.
Tools and Libraries:
Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Matplotlib: For static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical graphics and advanced visualizations.
SQLite: For storing and querying the dataset efficiently.
Methodology:
Data Loading and Storage:

Import the dataset using Pandas.
Store the data in an SQLite database.
Use SQL queries to extract necessary information for analysis.
Data Cleaning:

Identify and handle missing values by filling, dropping, or imputing as appropriate.
Remove duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
Ensure all columns have appropriate data types for subsequent analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Generate summary statistics using Pandas.
Visualize the number of restaurants in different cities using bar charts.
Plot the distribution of ratings with histograms and density plots.
Analyze the relationship between price range and ratings using scatter plots and box plots.
Examine the frequency of different cuisines using bar plots.
Visualization and Interpretation:

Create detailed visualizations to represent the data findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Use Seaborn for advanced visualizations like heatmaps to show correlations.
Interpret the visualizations to provide insights into restaurant trends on Zomato.
Expected Outcomes:
A comprehensive understanding of the distribution and characteristics of restaurants on Zomato.
Insights into how different factors such as location, price, and cuisine type affect restaurant ratings.
Visual representations that effectively communicate the key findings of the analysis.
Recommendations for stakeholders in the restaurant industry based on the analysis
